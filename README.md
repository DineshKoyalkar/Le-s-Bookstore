# Le's Bookstore

This is an e-commerce web application built by me while covering the [udemy]([https://www.udemy.com/complete-e-commerce-course-javaspringhibernate-and-mysql/](https://www.udemy.com/complete-e-commerce-course-javaspringhibernate-and-mysql/)) course using Java,Spring,Hibernate and MySQL. The project was built focusing the MVC pattern. It is divided into two individual modules one is [adminportal]([https://github.com/mefalamin/Le-s-Bookstore-adminportal](https://github.com/mefalamin/Le-s-Bookstore-adminportal)) and another is [user-section]([https://github.com/mefalamin/Le-s-Bookstore-user-section](https://github.com/mefalamin/Le-s-Bookstore-user-section)) running both independently. Some features are still under development. Hope you can have an idea of building a site using Java, Spring and hibernate by this project.
